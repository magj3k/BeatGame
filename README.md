# Square Wave

To Play:
`python main.py`

To-Do:
- add instructions for controls (space left right for explore, arrow keys for puzzle?)
- fix bug where moving keys before gems appear messes up audio offset

Story:
- WHERE ARE YOU
- LISTEN CLOSELY
- 

Suggestions:
- make background key graphically different to indicate that it can't be moved
- maybe start puzzle mode in melody mode?
- add countdown into fight mode
- moving projectiles
- make it so that you can't walk through a raised jumppad
