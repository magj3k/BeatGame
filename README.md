# Square Wave

To Play:
`python main.py`

To-Do:
*- 3-min presentation + 2-min next steps
*- fix bug where moving keys before gems appear messes up audio offset
*- End game (white background, trippy, "you are here"), credits
*- New music for both menu & end game (using square waves?)
- add instructions for controls (space left right for explore, arrow keys for puzzle?)
*- Panels for beginning of each level (WHERE ARE YOU, LISTEN CLOSELY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING, WHAT'S GOING ON, FIGHT AND FLIGHT, YOU ARE HERE)

Suggestions:
- make background key graphically different to indicate that it can't be moved
- maybe start puzzle mode in melody mode?
- add countdown into fight mode
- moving projectiles
- make it so that you can't walk through a raised jumppad
